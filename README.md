# gitbuddy
gitbuddy is a simple terminal UI written in Rust using [tui-rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs) to perform basic git commands inspired by [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit). gitbuddy is still very much a work in progress and can only currently do the simplest of tasks/commands.
